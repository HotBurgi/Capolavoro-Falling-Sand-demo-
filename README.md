# Falling Sand Simulation Documentation

This document provides comprehensive documentation for a falling sand particle simulation program implemented using Pygame.

## Program Overview

The program simulates the behavior of falling sand particles within a grid. It consists of six main files, each serving a specific purpose:

- `const.py`: Contains constant values used throughout the program.
- `draw.py`: Handles the drawing of sand particles on the screen.
- `falling.py`: Manages the state update and movement of sand particles.
- `inputManagement.py`: Handles user input for spawning new sand particles.
- `main.py`: Contains the main loop of the program, handling initialization and event processing.
- `slide.py`: Implements the sliding movement of sand particles.
